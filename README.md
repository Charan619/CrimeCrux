### Visual Heat-map dashboard for each category of crime

Understanding large amount of data across many years and states is almost imposible with just lines and numbers. To make things simpler for the user we implemented a country-wide heat map for each given year and crime category.

### Crime index per population for each State

India is a very large country with varying population densities for each district. This introduces an implicit bias for states with high population and showcases them in a bad light. To solve this we showed the data normalized for population to understand which states have high crime per capita
